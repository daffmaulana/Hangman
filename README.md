# Hangman Guessing Game 🎯
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. Each correct guess reveals the positions of the guessed letter in the word, while each incorrect guess adds a part to a hanging man figure. The player wins by guessing the word before the figure is fully drawn. The game typically includes a simple text-based interface, allowing players to input their guesses and receive feedback on their progress.
